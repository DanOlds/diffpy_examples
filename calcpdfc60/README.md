This is a short example script to showcase part of the diffpy.srreal package.
It uses the DebyePDFCalculator to calculate a pair distribution function for a
bucky ball (C60 molecle). The DebyePDFCalculator module is useful alternative
to the PDFCalculator module for calculating pair distribution functions for
individual molecules and nanoparticles.
