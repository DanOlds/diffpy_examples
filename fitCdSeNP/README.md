# Fit CdSe Nanoparticle PDF

This is an example of using the DiffPy-CMI framework to fit a X-ray PDF of
CdSe Nanoparticles.  It shows how to build a simple fit recipe using a PDF
data file and fit it using a non-periodic nanoparticle structure model.

To adapt this example to fit your own data, replace the ``dataFile`` and
``structureFile``.  You may need modify some variable names and the ADP to fit
your own structure model.
