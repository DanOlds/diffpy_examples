# Example scripts for calculating and refining magnetic PDFs

The python scripts and notebooks in this directory will give you an overview of how
to use diffpy.mpdf to calculate and refine magnetic PDFs. We recommend that you
start with introTutorial.ipynb to get an overall idea of how to use the software,
then explore some of the other examples. Many of the example scripts should be
straightforward to adapt to your own neutron PDF data to perform mPDF refinements.
