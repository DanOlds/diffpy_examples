#Fit Ni PDF

This is an example of using the DiffPy-CMI framework to fit a Ni neutron PDF. It
illustrates how to build a simple fit recipe with a PDF data file and a
structure uploaded from a cif file. It should be straightforward to adapt this
example to fit your own data.  Simply replace the ``dataFile`` and
``structureFile`` variables with your own and modify the ``spaceGroup`` variable
as appropriate.
